# Mezzala
Mezzala is a solution that i came up with to bridge the online gap between students and teacher. I believed to be worthy enough to fancy a prototype of it in MERN stack. And thats what ur looking into now!
  this folder contains all the server side scripts, inside the server folder.
  The client side scripts are uploaded to [this](https://github.com/Dozerex-creationz/dozerex-mezzala-client) repo which is also used as a base repo for hosting on netlify.
